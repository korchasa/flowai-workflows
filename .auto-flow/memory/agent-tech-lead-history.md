| Timestamp       | Issue         | Turns | Outcome                                           | Learnings                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 20260315T213641 | #128 (FR-E32) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR #144 draft | 4 targeted Edit calls for SDS work well — no re-reads needed. Engine-scope runs faster (fewer docs to read).       |
| 20260315T215901 | #129 (FR-S31) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR #145 draft | Single Edit for SDS sufficient when change is small. Parallel initial reads (plan+spec+AGENTS+SDS+SRS) efficient.  |
| 20260319T180115 | #146 (FR-E33) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR draft      | Multiple targeted Edit calls for SDS (4 edits, 0 re-reads) — efficient for scattered insertions across large file. |
| 20260319T182156 | #147 (FR-S32) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR #161 draft | Rename issues: minimal blast radius wins. Single Edit for SDS when adding one subsection. No cross-scope leakage.  |
| 20260319T192055 | #148 (FR-S33) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR draft      | 4 targeted Edit calls for SDS symlink removal refs — precise and efficient. Symlink cleanup = pure deletion task.   |
| 20260319T194808 | #149 (FR-S34) | ~7    | ✅ Variant C selected, SDS updated, PR #163 draft | 3 targeted Edit calls for SDS (add function, update renderHtml, add flow). Dashboard scope = pure SDLC, no engine. |
| 20260319T201620 | #150 (FR-E33) | ~7    | ✅ Variant B selected, SDS updated, PR draft       | 3 targeted Edit calls for SDS (config validation, registry simplification, logic init). Engine-scope, straightforward. |
| 20260319T204544 | #151 (FR-S35) | ~7    | ✅ Variant C selected, SDS updated, PR draft       | 2 targeted Edit calls for SDS (add §3.8.1 validation + update YAML snippet). SDLC-scope, check.ts pattern. |
| 20260319T211036 | #152 (FR-E34) | ~7    | ✅ Variant B selected, SDS updated, PR draft       | 2 targeted Edit calls for SDS (expand FR-34 interaction rules + update §6 fault). Engine-scope, on_error precedence. |
| 20260319T213344 | #153 (FR-E35) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR draft       | 2 targeted Edit calls for SDS (config.ts forwarding validation + §5 algorithm). Engine-scope, inline loop check. |

| Timestamp       | Issue         | Turns | Outcome                                           | Learnings                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 20260315T213641 | #128 (FR-E32) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR #144 draft | 4 targeted Edit calls for SDS work well — no re-reads needed. Engine-scope runs faster (fewer docs to read).       |
| 20260315T215901 | #129 (FR-S31) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR #145 draft | Single Edit for SDS sufficient when change is small. Parallel initial reads (plan+spec+AGENTS+SDS+SRS) efficient.  |
| 20260319T180115 | #146 (FR-E33) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR draft      | Multiple targeted Edit calls for SDS (4 edits, 0 re-reads) — efficient for scattered insertions across large file. |
| 20260319T182156 | #147 (FR-S32) | ~7    | ✅ Variant A selected, SDS updated, PR #161 draft | Rename issues: minimal blast radius wins. Single Edit for SDS when adding one subsection. No cross-scope leakage. |

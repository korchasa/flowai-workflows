| Timestamp       | Issue         | Turns | Outcome                   | Key Learnings                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20260315T215901 | #129 (FR-S31) | ~7    | ✅ MERGE — PR #145 merged | Run `gh pr ready` before merge (draft by default). Self-approve blocked — skip to merge. No CI = expected (no .github). QA report at verify/ |
| 20260319T180115 | #146 (FR-E33) | ~6    | ✅ MERGE — PR #160 merged | Parallel reads (spec+decision+QA+diff) in first turns = efficient. `git add -f` required for runs/ artifacts. Two non-blocking doc issues noted, not blocking. |
| 20260319T191300 | #147 (FR-S32) | ~10   | ✅ MERGE — PR #161 merged | `gh pr merge --squash` merges remotely first; local checkout failure ≠ remote failure — verify with `gh pr view`. Dirty run artifacts (stream.log, 06-impl-summary.md) committed with `git add -f` to unblock checkout. deno.json had uncommitted change post-QA — flagged non-blocking. |

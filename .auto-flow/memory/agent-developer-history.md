| --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 20260319T180115 | #146 (FR-E33) | ~9    | ✅ 5 files changed, 493 tests pass, committed and pushed      | Pre-existing fmt in committed file: stash not applicable; must fix directly. All 5 edits in parallel = efficient run.                                        |
| 20260319T182156 | #147 (FR-S32) | ~15   | ✅ 9 files changed, 493 tests pass, committed and pushed      | Rename-only: grep sweep is acceptance gate. SDS already correct (tech-lead updated). Markdown table widths: binary-search approach when exact width unknown. |
| 20260319T182156 | #147 iter2    | ~5    | ✅ 1 file changed (SRS), 493 tests pass, committed and pushed | QA fix: PM's FR-S32 SRS section dropped in iter 1; read 01-spec.md to recover intent, added section 3.32 + Appendix C row.                                   |
| 20260319T192055 | #148 (FR-S33) | ~5    | ⚠️ iter1: 7 files changed, PASS but QA FAIL (SRS missing)    | Delete-only + block removal: SDS already updated by tech-lead. SRS not updated → QA blocked.                                                                 |
| 20260319T192055 | #148 iter2    | ~8    | ✅ 1 file changed (SRS), 493 tests pass, committed and pushed | Same QA-fix pattern as #147 iter2: PM's SRS changes (§3.33, NFR §4, Appendix B/C) not in branch; reconstructed from 01-spec.md + QA report.                  |
| 20260319T194808 | #149 (FR-S34) | ~7    | ✅ 2 files changed, 509 tests pass, committed and pushed      | Write both files; lint: deno-lint-ignore inside for-loop header = ban-unused-ignore; fix: extract cast to separate variable before loop.                       |
| 20260319T194808 | #149 iter2    | ~5    | ✅ 1 file changed (SRS), 509 tests pass, committed and pushed | QA fix: PM's FR-S34 SRS section not persisted; added §3.34 + Appendix C row. Third consecutive issue with this PM persistence failure (#147, #148, #149). |
| 20260319T201620 | #150 (FR-E33) | ~10   | ✅ 5 files changed, 514 tests pass, committed and pushed      | Mutual-exclusivity validation: pipeline.yaml used BOTH mechanisms → necessary fix outside tasks[].files scope. Task breakdown must include all affected files. |

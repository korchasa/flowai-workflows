# Reflection Memory — agent-developer

## Anti-patterns

- **`assertRejects` not in vendor assert.ts**: only `assertEquals` and `assertThrows` exported. Use try/catch + assertEquals for async throw tests.
- **New ErrorCategory values need types.ts update**: custom category strings not in the type → either add to types.ts or omit `error_category` in the LoopResult return.
- **HEAD version of out-of-scope file can have pre-existing fmt issue**: `git stash push -- <file>` only works for local verification but NOT for engine's `deno task check` continuation — engine runs check on actual working tree. Must fix pre-existing fmt issues directly and commit them. Markdown table column alignment (trailing whitespace padding) is a common offender.
- **`deno-lint-ignore` inside for-loop header is not recognized**: placing `// deno-lint-ignore no-explicit-any` before `const [k, v] of Object.entries(x as Record<string, any>)` inside a for-loop header fails with `ban-unused-ignore`. Extract the cast to a separate variable on the line directly after the ignore comment instead.

- Writing complete files (Write) for simple section inserts when Edit would work
- Not checking deno fmt compliance before writing — blank lines between headings and list items required
- Splitting import updates and test additions into separate Edit calls (one Write/Edit per file rule)
- NOT committing immediately after deno task check passes — background self_runner resets to main
- Writing indentation incorrectly in multi-line function call args (matching the wrong reference level)
- Placing import statements at the bottom of a file (TS requires all imports at top)
- Leaving extra trailing blank line at end of file — deno fmt expects exactly one trailing newline
- **Edit tool says "File has not been read yet"** even when file was Read in an earlier response batch —
  must re-Read (even with offset/limit trick) to satisfy the Edit tool's session tracking

## Effective Strategies

- ONE Edit for single-location changes; ONE Write for multi-location changes (whole file rewrite)
- All parallel Reads + git log in first turn = minimal turns
- Pre-flight git log check prevents wasted work on pre-committed tasks
- COMMIT IMMEDIATELY after writing code — then run deno task check; self_runner can reset during check
- When a pre-existing fmt failure blocks check (out-of-scope file): `git stash push -- <file>`, run check,
  `git stash pop`. Confirms own code is correct without losing another agent's uncommitted work.
- For nested multi-arg calls, count indentation level carefully
- For extraction refactors (no behavioral change): existing tests are the acceptance gate — no new tests needed
- When removing imports: trace each symbol to confirm it is truly unused after extraction before deleting
- **Self-referential safety for prompt deletions:** Don't delete `.auto-flow/agents/agent-*/SKILL.md` files
  during a pipeline run — the engine may still need them for later nodes in the current run

## Environment Quirks

- `deno fmt` checks ALL `.md` files in the repo, not just TypeScript
- Memory files require blank lines between `##` headings and first list item (deno fmt rule)
- deno task check output >50KB persisted to temp file — no `<error>` wrapper = PASS; check tail for "All checks passed!"
- **CRITICAL**: `scripts/self_runner.ts` runs as background process. When `.auto-flow/lock.json` is absent,
  self_runner starts a new pipeline run → calls `.auto-flow/scripts/reset-to-main.sh` →
  `git checkout -f main && git reset --hard origin/main && git clean -fd`. DESTROYS all uncommitted changes.
- TypeScript `.some((e) => ...)` callbacks need explicit `: string` type annotation to avoid TS7006
- "File has been modified since read" appears due to background resets — always re-read before writing
- **Pre-existing dirty files from other agents can fail deno fmt check**: use `git stash push -- <file>`
  to temporarily clear them, verify own code passes, then `git stash pop` to restore
- **Edit tool session tracking**: Re-read files with offset/limit (small range) to satisfy "File has not
  been read yet" errors — happens when file was Read in a previous parallel batch

## Self-Referential SKILL.md Deletions

- When the task is pure markdown deletion from SKILL.md files (no TS logic), no tests are needed per "DO NOT test constants/templates".
- All 6 edits can be issued in parallel in one turn for maximum efficiency.

## Doc-Only Run Pattern

- When all 4 tasks are documentation-only (no TS logic), no tests needed.
- Large markdown files (>89KB) can't be Read in full — use targeted Grep + Read
  by offset/limit to locate specific sections, then issue multiple Edit calls.
- Multiple parallel Edit calls on same large file is efficient and reliable when
  each old_string is unique (avoids full-file Write which requires full read).
- design-sdlc.md may already be updated by Tech Lead in the decide phase — check §8
  for existing FR-S<N> entry before writing.

## Scope-Check Module Pattern (FR-E37)

- `scope_check` is an internal-only `ValidationRule.type` — added to the union but never user-configured in YAML.
- Synthetic `ValidationResult` uses `path: ""` (empty string) since scope_check has no file path concept.
- While loop condition must be widened: `validationRules.length > 0 || node.allowed_paths !== undefined` — otherwise loop skips when no validate rules but scope check is active.
- `allPassed([])` returns `true` (Array.every on empty), so loop exits correctly when no rules and no scope violations.
- `beforeSnapshot` updated to `afterSnapshot` after each iteration — incremental detection, not cumulative.
- `globMatch()` implemented inline: `**` → `.*`, `*` → `[^/]*`, `?` → `[^/]`, literals escaped.

- **FR-E36 appendix gap**: When adding FR-E37 appendix row, also check that FR-E36 is in
  the appendix — it was missing (section existed in main but row was never added). Safe to
  fix both in the same QA-fix commit.

## Hook Template Validation Pattern (FR-E7)

- `validateTemplateVars()` is the pure validation twin of `resolve()` in template.ts — same prefix/key logic, no I/O, accumulates errors.
- Hook validation in `validateNode()` placed after type-specific checks (agent/loop/human), before `run_on` validation.
- Loop body nodes automatically get the combined `[...allNodeIds, ...bodyNodeIds]` context via the existing `validInputIds` already passed to recursive `validateNode()` calls — no special-casing needed.
- `env.*` and `args.*` are always accepted in validateTemplateVars (any suffix valid, resolved at runtime).

## Artifact Fields Pattern (FR-E38)

- `fields?: string[]` on `ValidationRule` — optional, presence-only check (not value constraint).
- `validateValidationRule()` change: old "requires non-empty sections" → new "at least one of sections/fields".
  Must update 2 existing tests that checked the old error message.
- `checkArtifact()` field check placed after sections check. Uses `^key:\s*(.*)$` regex with `m` flag;
  checks `!fieldMatch || !fieldMatch[1].trim()` to catch both absent and empty-valued fields.
- No `assertRejects` needed — all sync config tests use `assertThrows`.

## Binary Distribution Pattern (FR-E39)

- `VERSION` constant uses `Deno.env.get("VERSION") ?? "dev"` — embedded at compile time via `deno compile --env-file <tmpfile>` where tmpfile contains `VERSION=<tag>`.
- `getVersionString()` exported for testability; `--version`/`-V` case in parseArgs calls it + `Deno.exit(0)` (same as `--help`).
- `scripts/compile.ts` writes a temp env file, iterates targets, runs `deno compile --allow-all --target <t> --env-file <f> --output <name> engine/cli.ts`, removes temp file in `finally` block.
- Release workflow: `ubuntu-latest` for all 4 targets (cross-compilation handled by deno compile's built-in cross-target support); `actions/upload-artifact` per job; final job uses `actions/download-artifact` with `merge-multiple: true` then `gh release create`.
- No test needed for `--version` flag itself (calls Deno.exit; same untested pattern as `--help`). Test VERSION type + getVersionString format instead.

- Target: ≤35 turns. Key lesson: commit before deno task check; stash pattern for pre-existing fmt issues.

## Pipeline.yaml Coexistence Pattern

- When engine validation is tightened to reject a config pattern, the reference pipeline.yaml may use that pattern and must be fixed simultaneously.
- Tech-lead task breakdown should include `pipeline.yaml` when validation changes affect it.
- Fix: remove the redundant mechanism (per-node `phase:` fields when top-level `phases:` block is authoritative).

## QA-Fix Pattern

- When QA flags a missing SRS section: read the spec (01-spec.md) for the PM's exact stated SRS changes, then reconstruct the missing section matching the project SRS format. Look at adjacent sections (e.g., 3.31) for format reference.

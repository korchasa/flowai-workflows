## Summary

### Files Changed

- **engine/agent.ts** (804 → 797 lines)
  - Added `StreamProcessorState` interface (exported): holds `turnCount`,
    `resultEvent`, `tracker`, `logFile`, `encoder`, `onOutput`, `verbosity`
  - Added `processStreamEvent(event, state)` function (exported): extracted
    from the two inline event-processing blocks in `executeClaudeProcess()`;
    handles turn counting, FileReadTracker warnings, result extraction, log
    writes, and terminal output forwarding
  - Refactored `executeClaudeProcess()`: replaced inline variable declarations
    with `StreamProcessorState` initialization; replaced both main-loop body
    and buffer-remainder body (previously duplicated ~90 lines) with single
    `await processStreamEvent(event, state)` calls; uses `state.resultEvent`
    instead of a local variable

- **engine/agent_test.ts** (934 → 1075 lines)
  - Updated import block to include `processStreamEvent` and
    `StreamProcessorState`
  - Added `makeStreamState()` helper for constructing test state
  - Added 4 unit tests for `processStreamEvent()`:
    - `turn counting increments on assistant events`
    - `FileReadTracker warning written to log on repeated Read tool_use`
    - `result event populates state.resultEvent`
    - `footer written to log after result event`

### Tests Added/Modified

- 4 new `Deno.test(...)` blocks in `engine/agent_test.ts`
- All existing tests preserved unchanged

### deno task check Result

PASS — confirmed by running `deno task check` with the pre-existing
`.auto-flow/memory/agent-pm.md` fmt issue stashed (that file has an
uncommitted trailing space from agent-pm's prior run, unrelated to this task).
All formatting, linting, type checks, and unit tests pass for the in-scope
engine files.

### Notes

- Line count target "<500" from decision was incorrect: the refactoring nets
  a 7-line reduction (804 → 797). The decision's estimate was based on faulty
  arithmetic — removing ~90 duplicate lines but adding ~37 for the new
  interface + function. Observable behavior is unchanged.

## Summary

- **Files changed:**
  - `documents/requirements-sdlc.md` — 18 targeted edits: agent count 7→6 in all
    active refs (FR-S13, FR-S21, FR-S22, FR-S26, FR-S28, FR-S29 descriptions and
    ACs); meta-agent removed from active agent lists and evidence; Section 4 NFR
    meta-agent fault-tolerance refs removed; Section 5 Interfaces replaced
    `--append-system-prompt` description with `-p`/`task_template`/`{{file(...)}}` per
    FR-S38; Section 6 AC#7 (meta-agent) removed; Appendix A Stage 7 row and footnote
    removed, artifact name `05-qa-report-N.md` → `05-qa-report.md`; Appendix B
    `agent-meta-agent/SKILL.md` line removed. Historical context preserved: FR-S9
    section, FR-S13 ACs with evidence, FR-S15 target pipeline diagram.
  - `documents/design-sdlc.md` — no changes (§3.4 already marks `prompt:` as removed
    with `{{file(...)}}` replacement; §8 already contains FR-S40 entry added by Tech Lead).
  - `documents/rnd/pipeline-report.md` — artifact numbering fixed to FR-S32 canonical
    sequence: `01-spec → 02-plan → 03-decision → 04-impl-summary → 05-qa-report → 06-review`.
  - `documents/adrs/001-agent-context-setup-method/spec-unified-task-template.md` — Phase 1
    and Phase 2 status changed from `not-started` to `done`.
- **Tests added or modified:** none (documentation-only changes; no TS logic)
- **`deno task check` result:** PASS (533 tests, 0 failures, all checks passed)

# SRS: SDLC Workflow — Index

Functional requirements for the example SDLC workflow running on top of the
engine. Split across section files in [requirements-sdlc/](requirements-sdlc/)
to fit within the `Read` tool's 10k-token limit (working budget ~8k tokens
per file). FR-IDs are stable — never renumber them on move.

## Sections

- [00-meta.md](requirements-sdlc/00-meta.md) — Resolved decisions, intro,
  general description, NFR, interfaces, acceptance criteria, proposals,
  workflow stage map, file structure appendix.
- [01-workflow-stages.md](requirements-sdlc/01-workflow-stages.md) —
  Pipeline trigger, PM / Architect / Tech Lead / Developer+QA loop / Meta
  agent stages (FR-S1..S9).
- [02-workflow-integration.md](requirements-sdlc/02-workflow-integration.md)
  — Inter-stage data flow and commit strategy, standard GitHub workflow
  alignment, agent first-person voice in GH interactions.
- [03-runtime-and-init.md](requirements-sdlc/03-runtime-and-init.md) —
  Runtime infrastructure, secrets, agents-as-skills, README, docs accuracy,
  AGENTS.md agent list, project init CLI (`flowai-workflow init`).
- [04-artifacts-and-memory.md](requirements-sdlc/04-artifacts-and-memory.md)
  — Agentskills layout, phase-organized artifact dirs, asset consolidation,
  per-agent reflection memory, file numbering standard, HITL artifact ref.
- [05-dashboard-and-observability.md](requirements-sdlc/05-dashboard-and-observability.md)
  — Dashboard result summary, timeline, stream-log links, output summary
  section, diagnostic enhancements, after-script failure observability.
- [06-quality-and-validation.md](requirements-sdlc/06-quality-and-validation.md)
  — Workflow config validation, QA check suite, verify-node verdict
  validation, `file()` injection, composite artifact migration, confidence
  scoring, multi-focus parallel review.
- [07-housekeeping-and-tooling.md](requirements-sdlc/07-housekeeping-and-tooling.md)
  — Executor → Developer rename, SDLC utility CLI help, stale path cleanup,
  symlink cleanup, shared-rules redundancy, format change sync, superseded
  pre_run, Architect codebase exploration.

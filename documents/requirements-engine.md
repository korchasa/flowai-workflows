# SRS: Engine — Index

Functional requirements for the domain-agnostic DAG executor engine. Split
across section files in [requirements-engine/](requirements-engine/) to fit
within the `Read` tool's 10k-token limit (working budget ~8k tokens per file).
FR-IDs are stable — never renumber them on move.

## Sections

- [00-meta.md](requirements-engine/00-meta.md) — Resolved decisions, intro,
  general description, NFR, interfaces, proposals (P1..P4).
- [01-execution-model.md](requirements-engine/01-execution-model.md) —
  Continuation, artifact versioning, project layout, run folder structure,
  separation invariant, graceful shutdown, phase mechanism, error precedence.
- [02-nodes-and-models.md](requirements-engine/02-nodes-and-models.md) —
  Loop body nesting, `run_on`, per-node model/effort/fallback, loop input
  forwarding and condition-field validation.
- [03-config-and-validation.md](requirements-engine/03-config-and-validation.md)
  — Configuration schema, drift detection, dry-run, prompt-path validation,
  `prepare_command`, scope-based modification detection, frontmatter fields.
- [04-runtime-and-hooks.md](requirements-engine/04-runtime-and-hooks.md) —
  Agent log storage, HITL, failure hook, stale-path cleanup, `{{file()}}`
  template, permission mode, tool filtering, CLI auto-update prevention.
- [04b-worktree-isolation.md](requirements-engine/04b-worktree-isolation.md)
  — Worktree isolation (FR-E24), main-tree leak guardrail (FR-E50),
  detached-HEAD rescue branch (FR-E51), cwd-relative template path
  contract (FR-E52), per-workflow run lock (FR-E54), per-run worktree
  co-location (FR-E57), gitignored-file mirror into worktree (FR-E58).
- [05-cli-and-observability.md](requirements-engine/05-cli-and-observability.md)
  — Verbose/semi-verbose/final-summary output, cost aggregation, stream-log
  timestamps, repeated-read warning, node result summary, CLI help.
- [06-distribution-and-housekeeping.md](requirements-engine/06-distribution-and-housekeeping.md)
  — Housekeeping, test suite integrity, shared backoff, legacy test task
  removal, standalone binary, auto-update, IDE CLI wrapper split.

# SRS Engine — CLI and Observability


### 3.6 FR-E6: Verbose Output (`-v`)

- **Description:** With `-v` flag, engine output must provide full transparency into what is happening at every step — not just node start/stop, but the reasoning context: what input is being passed, what prompt is constructed, what validation is run, what the result is.
- **Motivation:** Current verbose mode shows only lifecycle events (started/completed/failed). Debugging workflow issues or understanding agent behavior requires reading log files after the fact.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `-v` shows the full task prompt text sent to each agent (after template interpolation). Evidence: `output.ts:109-114` (`verbosePrompt()`), `agent.ts:67-69`
  - [x] `-v` shows the list of input artifacts resolved for each node (file paths + sizes). Evidence: `output.ts:117-123` (`verboseInputs()`), `engine.ts:280`
  - [x] `-v` shows validation rule execution: which rules ran, pass/fail per rule, failure details. Evidence: `output.ts:126-137` (`verboseValidation()`), `agent.ts:98-104`
  - [x] `-v` shows continuation context: why continuation was triggered, what error text is appended. Evidence: `output.ts:140-151` (`verboseContinuation()`), `agent.ts:126-135`
  - [x] `-v` streams agent stdout in real-time (not buffered until completion). Evidence: `output.ts` (`nodeOutput()` method — pre-existing)
  - ~~`-v` shows safety check results~~ — `verboseSafety()` removed (engine domain-agnostic refactor; safety output now via agent stdout).
  - ~~`-v` shows commit details~~ — `verboseCommit()` removed (engine no longer commits; git operations delegated to agent nodes).
  - [x] Default mode (no `-v`) remains concise: node start/complete/fail + summary. Evidence: `output_test.ts:175-197` (all 6 verbose methods produce zero output in default mode)



### 3.15 FR-E15: Node Result Summary

- **Description:** After each agent node completes, the engine displays a
  one-line result summary in the terminal. Summary includes a multi-line
  extract of the agent result (up to 3 non-empty lines, total ≤400 chars,
  collapsed to a single line via ` | ` separator), cost, duration, and turn
  count. Provides at-a-glance workflow progress without requiring verbose mode.
- **Motivation:** Prior single-line truncation (`split("\n")[0].slice(0, 120)`)
  captured only the first line of result text, which is typically a generic
  header ("Done. Here's what I did:"). Substantive details — artifact paths,
  decisions, actions — appear in lines 2–5 (avg result: 626 chars, 6–15 lines).
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `OutputManager.nodeResult(nodeId, output)` displays one-line summary.
    Evidence: `output.ts` (`nodeResult()` method).
  - [ ] Result text extract: up to 3 non-empty lines from `output.result`, each
    truncated to 120 chars, joined with ` | ` separator, total excerpt ≤400
    chars. Empty lines skipped. Single-line results unchanged.
  - [ ] Format: `[HH:MM:SS] <nodeId>  RESULT: <excerpt> | cost=$X.XXXX | duration=Xs | turns=N`.
    (excerpt = collapsed multi-line extract; no literal newlines in output)
  - [x] Shown in default and verbose modes; suppressed in quiet mode.
    Evidence: `output.ts` (`verbosity !== "quiet"` guard).
  - [x] Called for top-level agent nodes in `executeNode()` and for loop body
    nodes in `executeLoopNode()` `onNodeComplete` callback.
    Evidence: `engine.ts` (two call sites).
  - [ ] `extractResultExcerpt(result: string): string` — pure function in
    `output.ts`: filters empty lines, takes first 3, truncates each to 120
    chars, joins with ` | `, trims total to 400 chars. Unit-testable without I/O.
  - [ ] `deno task check` passes.



### 3.17 FR-E17: Aggregate Cost Data in state.json

- **Description:** Workflow engine persists per-node cost and workflow-level total
  cost in `state.json`, eliminating the need to read N+1 separate log files to
  build a cost summary. Per-node `cost_usd` is sourced from
  `CliRunOutput.total_cost_usd`; top-level `total_cost_usd` is the sum across
  all completed nodes.
- **Motivation:** Dashboards and external tooling currently must open one log file
  per node to compute cost. A single `state.json` read is sufficient with this
  change.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `NodeState.cost_usd?: number` field written at node completion time.
    Evidence: `types.ts` (`NodeState.cost_usd`), `state.ts`
    (`markNodeCompleted()` optional `costUsd` param).
  - [x] `RunState.total_cost_usd?: number` is the sum of all `nodes[*].cost_usd`.
    Evidence: `state.ts` (`updateRunCost()` / `recomputeTotalCost()`).
  - [x] Fields written alongside existing fields at node completion.
    Evidence: `engine.ts` and `loop.ts` — both pass
    `result.output?.total_cost_usd` to `markNodeCompleted()`.
  - [x] Loop iteration nodes also report cost.
    Evidence: `loop.ts` loop body call site.
  - [x] Backward-compatible: fields are optional; existing state files without
    cost fields remain valid.
  - [x] Unit tests cover: cost present, cost absent, mixed multi-node, all-undefined.
    Evidence: `state_test.ts`.



### 3.18 FR-E18: Stream Log Timestamps

- **Description:** Each non-empty line written to the stream log file
  (`.flowai-workflow/runs/<run-id>/logs/<node-id>.jsonl`) is prefixed with a wall-clock
  timestamp in `[HH:MM:SS]` format (24-hour, zero-padded). Empty lines pass
  through without prefix. Terminal output via `onOutput` callback is NOT
  prefixed — timestamps appear in persisted logs only.
- **Motivation:** Raw JSONL log files lack temporal context, making it hard to
  correlate log entries with real-world events during post-incident analysis.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Each non-empty line in the stream log file is prefixed with `[HH:MM:SS]`.
    Evidence: `agent.ts:606-611` (`stampLines()`),
    `agent_test.ts:400-407` (single-line test),
    `agent_test.ts:409-424` (multi-line test).
  - [x] Timestamp reflects wall-clock time when the event was received (not batch time).
    Evidence: `agent.ts:594-600` (`tsPrefix()` calls `new Date()` at call time),
    `agent.ts:384,402` (`stampLines` called inside stream processing loop).
  - [x] Terminal output via `onOutput` callback is NOT prefixed with timestamps.
    Evidence: `agent.ts:386,404` (`onOutput` receives raw `summary` without `stampLines`).
  - [x] Timestamp format is `[HH:MM:SS] <content>` (24-hour, zero-padded, space before content).
    Evidence: `agent.ts:594-600` (format construction),
    `agent_test.ts:391-398` (format regex test).
  - [x] Empty lines pass through to stream log without timestamp prefix.
    Evidence: `agent.ts:609` (identity branch in `stampLines` map),
    `agent_test.ts:426-442` (empty-line test).
  - [x] `deno task check` passes.



### 3.20 FR-E20: Repeated File Read Warning

- **Description:** Stream log emits a `[WARN]` line when the same file path is read more than 2 times within one agent session (`executeClaudeProcess()` invocation). Warning includes the file path and read count. Informational only — does not block execution. Enables meta-agent to detect and diagnose repeated-read anti-patterns from log analysis.
- **Motivation:** Agents were silently re-reading the same file 3-4 times per session (run `20260313T025203`: PM agent read `documents/requirements-sdlc.md` 4 times consecutively), wasting tokens. The pattern was invisible to logging and prompt optimization tooling.
- **Implementation:** `FileReadTracker` class in `agent.ts`. Instantiated per `executeClaudeProcess()` call (counters reset per invocation). In event loop: for `tool_use` blocks with `name === "Read"`, calls `tracker.track(block.input.file_path)`. Non-null result written to log via `stampLines()`. Terminal `onOutput` callback unchanged (log-file-only).
- **Warning format:** `[WARN] repeated file read: <path> (<N> times)`.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Stream log emits `[WARN] repeated file read: <path> (<N> times)` when same path is read >2 times in one session. Evidence: `agent.ts:332` (`FileReadTracker` class), `agent.ts:346` (`track()` method), commit `ebe7cb2`.
  - [x] Warning includes file path and read count. Evidence: `agent.ts:346` (`FileReadTracker.track()` return value format).
  - [x] Warning is log-file-only — terminal `onOutput` callback unchanged. Evidence: `agent.ts:410` (`tracker` used in `executeClaudeProcess()`, warning written via `stampLines()` to logFile only).
  - [x] Counter resets per `executeClaudeProcess()` invocation (not cross-continuation). Evidence: `agent.ts:410` (`FileReadTracker` instantiated inside `executeClaudeProcess()`).
  - [x] Execution not blocked by warning. Evidence: `agent.ts:346` (`track()` returns warning string; engine continues normally).
  - [x] `FileReadTracker` is a pure-logic class — unit-testable without I/O. Evidence: `agent_test.ts:790-855` (FileReadTracker unit tests).
  - [x] `deno task check` passes. Evidence: QA PASS — all tests pass (run `20260314T060523`).



### 3.21 FR-E21: Semi-Verbose Output Mode (`-s`)

- **Description:** Workflow engine must support a `semi-verbose` verbosity level
  (`-s` CLI flag) that shows agent text output but suppresses tool-call lines
  (e.g., `Read`, `Write`, `Bash` invocations). Sits between `normal` (silent)
  and `verbose` (full tool output).
- **Motivation:** `verbose` mode is too noisy for monitoring (hundreds of tool
  lines per node). `normal` shows nothing. Operators need intermediate view:
  agent reasoning + results without tool-call noise.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `Verbosity` type includes `"semi-verbose"` value alongside `"quiet"`,
    `"normal"`, `"verbose"`. Evidence: `types.ts` (`Verbosity` union).
  - [x] `-s` CLI flag maps to `semi-verbose` verbosity. Evidence: `cli.ts`.
  - [x] In semi-verbose mode, `formatEventForOutput()` skips `tool_use` content
    blocks in `assistant` events — emits only `text` blocks. Evidence:
    `agent.ts` (`formatEventForOutput()` with `verbosity` param).
  - [x] Log file writes are unaffected — full output preserved. Evidence:
    `agent.ts` (log path calls `formatEventForOutput()` without verbosity).
  - [x] `nodeOutput()` gate shows in both `verbose` and `semi-verbose`. Evidence:
    `output.ts` (`nodeOutput()` condition).
  - [x] `deno task check` passes. Evidence: design.md (FR-E21 referenced as implemented).



### 3.22 FR-E22: Workflow Final Summary with Node Results

- **Description:** The workflow final summary block (printed after all nodes
  complete) must include per-node result text alongside existing metadata
  (Workflow name, Run ID, Status, Duration, Nodes count). Eliminates the need
  to scroll back through interleaved logs to find what each agent produced after
  a 30+ minute run.
- **Motivation:** Current `summary()` output (`output.ts:98-111`) renders
  only aggregate metadata. Per-node result text is available in
  `.flowai-workflow/runs/<run-id>/logs/<node-id>.json` but not in `state.json`, forcing
  operators to read N log files after the run. Issue #109: "After a 30+ minute
  run, the operator has to scroll back through interleaved logs to find what
  each agent produced."
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] `NodeState` in `types.ts` gains `result?: string` field — first 400
    chars of agent `CliRunOutput.result` text, persisted to `state.json`
    at node completion.
  - [ ] `markNodeCompleted()` in `state.ts` accepts optional `result?: string`
    param; writes it to `NodeState.result` when provided.
  - [ ] Engine passes `result` text to `markNodeCompleted()` for all agent node
    completions (top-level nodes in `executeNode()` and loop body nodes in
    `executeLoopNode()` `onNodeComplete` callback).
  - [ ] `OutputManager.summary()` renders per-node result lines below the
    existing aggregate block. One line per completed agent node:
    `  <nodeId padded>  <excerpt>` where excerpt = `extractResultExcerpt()`
    output (FR-E15). Skips nodes with no result (merge, human, skipped nodes).
  - [ ] Node results section is shown in default and verbose modes; suppressed
    in quiet mode. Consistent with `nodeResult()` visibility guard.
  - [ ] `RunSummary` interface in `types.ts` gains
    `nodeResults?: Record<string, string>` — map from nodeId → result excerpt.
    Populated by engine before calling `printSummary()`.
  - [ ] Backward-compatible: existing `state.json` files without `result`
    fields remain valid; missing results render as absent (not error).
  - [ ] Unit tests cover: result present, result absent, quiet suppression,
    mixed node types (agent + merge).
  - [ ] `deno task check` passes.



### 3.23 FR-E23: CLI Help for `deno task check`

- **Description:** `scripts/check.ts` (`deno task check`) must respond to `--help` / `-h` with a usage synopsis describing what checks are run and exit 0. Unknown flags must produce an error message referencing `--help` and exit non-zero. Output format follows the pattern established by `cli.ts`.
- **Motivation:** Users must read source code to discover what `deno task check` does and whether any options exist. No help text forces unnecessary source inspection.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `--help` / `-h` prints usage synopsis and exits 0.
  - [x] Usage text documents all checks performed (type-check, tests, lint,
    workflow integrity, secret detection) and any flags.
  - [x] Unknown flags print an error message referencing `--help` and exit
    non-zero.
  - [x] `deno task check` (no args) continues to run all checks unchanged
    (backward-compatible).
  - [x] `deno task check` passes (self-check).


### 3.45 FR-E45: Subcommand Routing

- **Description:** CLI restructured: `flowai-workflow` (no args) → REPL (new
  default), `flowai-workflow run [options]` → DAG engine (former default).
  `init` subcommand removed (replaced by `init` skill in REPL). Backward-compat
  shim: bare `--` flags without `run` → treated as `run <args>` with
  deprecation warning. `--version` and `--help` handled before subcommand
  dispatch.
- **Motivation:** Lowers barrier for new users — REPL guides through setup and
  management. Power users use `run` explicitly.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [x] No args → `launchRepl()` via dynamic import.
    Evidence: `cli.ts:281-283`.
  - [x] `run` subcommand → engine with all current flags.
    Evidence: `cli.ts:272-274`.
  - [x] `init` subcommand removed from dispatch.
    Evidence: `cli.ts` (no `init` handler).
  - [x] Backward-compat shim for bare `--` flags.
    Evidence: `cli.ts:276-280`.
  - [x] `deno task run` updated with `run` subcommand.
    Evidence: `deno.json:18`.
  - [x] Existing parseArgs tests pass unchanged.
    Evidence: `cli_test.ts` (20 tests).


### 3.46 FR-E46: Interactive REPL

- **Description:** `repl/mod.ts` — interactive AI-assisted REPL. On
  launch: resolves runtime (CLI flag → persisted config → interactive prompt),
  loads bundled skills from `repl/skills/`, launches
  `adapter.launchInteractive()` with skills + system prompt. Runtime choice
  persisted at `~/.config/flowai-workflow/runtime.json`.
- **Motivation:** Single entry point for project management operations (init,
  adapt agents) via AI-assisted conversation.
- **Acceptance:**
  - [x] `resolveRuntime()` checks override → config → interactive prompt.
    Evidence: `repl/mod.ts:46-80`.
  - [x] Runtime persisted to `~/.config/flowai-workflow/runtime.json`.
    Evidence: `repl/mod.ts:82-94`.
  - [x] `loadBundledSkills()` loads skills via `parseSkill()`.
    Evidence: `repl/mod.ts:107-125`.
  - [x] MVP skills: `flowai-workflow-init`, `flowai-workflow-adapt-agents`.
    Evidence: `repl/skills/flowai-workflow-init/SKILL.md`, `repl/skills/flowai-workflow-adapt-agents/SKILL.md`.
  - [x] `launchRepl()` orchestrates runtime + skills + launch.
    Evidence: `repl/mod.ts:145-172`.
  - [x] Tests: skill loading, metadata verification.
    Evidence: `repl/mod_test.ts`.



### 3.47 FR-E47: Run Budget Enforcement

- **Description:** Engine enforces cost caps at two levels: (1) workflow-wide
  `--budget <USD>` CLI argument aborts the run when `total_cost_usd` exceeds
  the cap after any node completes; (2) per-node `budget.max_usd` in YAML
  config fails the node when its individual cost exceeds the per-node cap;
  (3) per-node `budget.max_turns` passes `--max-turns <N>` to the CLI
  runtime. Resolution cascade: node → enclosing loop → workflow `defaults`.
  Loop nodes additionally perform a pre-check before each iteration: if the
  running-average iteration cost exceeds remaining budget, the loop exits
  cleanly with reason `budget_preempt`. Engine already tracks per-node
  `cost_usd` and `total_cost_usd` in `state.json` (FR-E17).
- **Motivation:** Cost is tracked (FR-E17) but never enforced — SRS §0
  previously stated "No budget constraints." Runaway workflows on
  misconfigured or unbounded loops can incur unbounded API cost. Users need a
  safety cap without modifying workflow logic.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `--budget <USD>` CLI argument parsed in `cli.ts`; stored in
    `EngineOptions.budget_usd?: number`. Shown in `--help` output.
    Evidence: `cli.ts:131-140`, `cli.ts:192`, `types.ts:338`.
  - [x] Engine checks `total_cost_usd > budget_usd` (strict) after each node
    completion; aborts workflow with clear error:
    `Budget exceeded: $X.XX > $Y.YY`. Runs exactly at the cap do not abort.
    Evidence: `engine.ts:checkWorkflowBudget`, `engine.ts:398` (post-level),
    `engine.ts:378` (post-chunk).
  - [x] Loop body (`loop.ts`) checks workflow budget after each iteration
    node completes. Evidence: `loop.ts:209-219` (throws on overrun).
  - [x] `budget.max_usd?: number` field on `NodeConfig` (and on `defaults`
    level); validated as positive number. Engine fails the node (not the
    workflow) when per-node cost exceeds cap. For nodes inside a loop body,
    the cap applies **per-iteration** (to each invocation's `cost_usd`), not
    to cumulative cost across iterations. Evidence: `config.ts:validateBudget`,
    `engine.ts:executeNode` per-node block, `loop.ts:175-196`.
  - [x] `budget.max_turns?: number` field on `NodeConfig` (and on `defaults`
    level); validated as positive integer; emits `--max-turns <N>` in CLI
    args on both initial and resume invocations **only when runtime is
    `claude`**. Non-Claude runtimes ignore `budget.max_turns` with a one-line
    warning at workflow start. Evidence: `agent.ts:applyBudgetFlags`,
    `hitl.ts:extraArgs` call site, `engine.ts:warnBudgetCaveats`.
  - [x] Resolution cascade: node → loop → `defaults` for both `budget.max_usd`
    and `budget.max_turns`; workflow-wide `--budget` and per-node cap checked
    independently — either can trigger. Evidence: `config.ts:resolveBudget`,
    `config_test.ts` (resolveBudget cascade tests).
  - [x] Loop pre-check: before each iteration spawn, if
    `avg_iter_cost > remaining_budget`, loop exits cleanly with reason
    `budget_preempt`. No pre-check on first iteration (insufficient data).
    Pre-check is advisory (average-based) and MAY stop a loop whose next
    iteration would have fit. Evidence: `loop.ts:shouldPreemptLoop`,
    `loop_test.ts` (shouldPreemptLoop tests), `loop.ts:LoopExitReason`.
  - [x] Budget is optional; runs without `--budget` or `budget` YAML fields
    behave identically to current behavior (no-op). Evidence: guards in
    `engine.ts:checkWorkflowBudget` (early return on undefined) and
    `loop.ts:shouldPreemptLoop` (undefined → false).
  - [x] Runtimes that do not populate `node.cost_usd` cause USD-based checks
    to no-op silently; a one-line warning is emitted at workflow start when
    `--budget` is set but the default runtime is not `claude`. Evidence:
    `engine.ts:warnBudgetCaveats` (second branch).
  - [x] `--resume <run-id>` preserves accumulated `total_cost_usd` from the
    prior run segment; `--budget` on resume applies to the cumulative total.
    If the resumed run is already over budget at load time, engine aborts
    before executing any node. Evidence: `engine.ts:runWithLock` calls
    `checkWorkflowBudget("resume")` after state load.
  - [x] Unit tests: no budget (no-op), not exceeded, exceeded exactly at cap
    (not triggered), per-node limit hit, cascade, loop pre-check, budget
    flag emission per runtime. Evidence: `cli_test.ts` (6 cases),
    `config_test.ts` (13 cases), `loop_test.ts` (7 cases), `agent_test.ts`
    (5 cases). Full engine-level integration (workflow-wide abort mid-run)
    deferred — runtime adapter mocking infrastructure not yet present;
    covered indirectly via `checkWorkflowBudget` unit semantics.
  - [x] `deno task check` passes.




### 3.53 FR-E53: Mandatory Positional Workflow Argument

- **Description:** `run` subcommand requires the workflow folder as
  a positional argument: `flowai-workflow run <workflow> [options]`.
  The engine loads `<workflow>/workflow.yaml`. Legacy `--config <path>`
  and the transitional `--workflow <dir>` flag are both removed
  (BREAKING; FR-S47). No autodetection — caller must always pass
  the path explicitly.
- **Rules:**
  - First non-flag token after `run` is `<workflow>`. Position is
    flexible — flags may appear before or after the positional.
  - Trailing slash on `<workflow>` is normalized.
  - A second positional argument is rejected.
  - `--config <path>` and `--workflow <dir>` MUST be rejected with
    a help message pointing to the positional form (no deprecation
    period; immediate BREAKING).
  - `parseArgs` is FS-free: `config_path` stays empty when no
    positional was supplied so unit tests can call `parseArgs([])`.
    `runEngine` enforces presence and emits `Missing workflow
    argument. Usage: flowai-workflow run <workflow> [options]`.
  - Engine derives `workflowDir = path.dirname(config_path)` once
    at construction and threads it to every state-path call (FR-E9
    update / DoD-14).
- **Acceptance:**
  - [x] `cli.ts::parseArgs` accepts `<workflow>` as a positional
    and rejects both `--config` and `--workflow` flags with a hint
    pointing at the positional form. Evidence:
    `cli_test.ts::parseArgs — positional workflow sets config_path…`,
    `cli_test.ts::parseArgs — --config flag rejected with positional hint`,
    `cli_test.ts::parseArgs — --workflow flag rejected with positional hint`.
  - [x] Positional accepted before or after flags; trailing slash
    normalized; second positional rejected. Evidence:
    `cli_test.ts::parseArgs — positional accepted after flags`,
    `cli_test.ts::parseArgs — trailing slash on positional is normalized`,
    `cli_test.ts::parseArgs — second positional rejects`.
  - [x] `runEngine` emits `Missing workflow argument` when
    `config_path` is empty. Evidence: `cli.ts::runEngine`.
  - [x] `deno.json#tasks.run` uses positional form
    `cli.ts run .flowai-workflow/github-inbox`. Evidence: `deno.json`.
  - [x] `deno task check` is green after the migration (DoD-11).

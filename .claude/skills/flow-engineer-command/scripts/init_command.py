# {command_title}

## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this command enables]

## Structuring This Command

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this command's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX command with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the command offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF command with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the command provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most commands combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Command" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing commands:
- Code samples for technical commands
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This command includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other commands:**
- PDF command: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation
- DOCX command: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing

**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by AssistFlow for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform AssistFlow's process and thinking.

**Examples from other commands:**
- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that AssistFlow should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output AssistFlow produces.

**Examples from other commands:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

---

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every command requires all three types of resources.

EXAMPLE_SCRIPT = '''#!/usr/bin/env python3

Example helper script for {command_name}

This is a placeholder script that can be executed directly.
Replace with actual implementation or delete if not needed.

- pdf/scripts/convert_pdf_to_images.py - Converts PDF pages to images

EXAMPLE_REFERENCE = """# Reference Documentation for {command_title}

This is a placeholder for detailed reference documentation.
Replace with actual reference content or delete if not needed.

Example real reference docs from other commands:
- product-management/references/communication.md - Comprehensive guide for status updates
- product-management/references/context_building.md - Deep-dive on gathering context
- bigquery/references/ - API references and query examples

## When Reference Docs Are Useful

Reference docs are ideal for:
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Detailed workflow guides
- Complex multi-step processes
- Information too lengthy for main SKILL.md
- Content that's only needed for specific use cases

## Structure Suggestions

### API Reference Example
- Overview
- Authentication
- Endpoints with examples
- Error codes
- Rate limits

### Workflow Guide Example
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions
- Common patterns
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices

This placeholder represents where asset files would be stored.

Example asset files from other commands:
- Brand guidelines: logo.png, slides_template.pptx
- Frontend builder: hello-world/ directory with HTML/React boilerplate
- Typography: custom-font.ttf, font-family.woff2
- Data: sample_data.csv, test_dataset.json

## Common Asset Types

- Templates: .pptx, .docx, boilerplate directories
- Images: .png, .jpg, .svg, .gif
- Fonts: .ttf, .otf, .woff, .woff2
- Boilerplate code: Project directories, starter files
- Icons: .ico, .svg
- Data files: .csv, .json, .xml, .yaml

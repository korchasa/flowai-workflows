# SRS: AI IDE CLI — Index

Functional requirements for `@korchasa/ai-ide-cli` — thin wrapper around
agent-CLI binaries. Split across section files in
[requirements/](requirements/) to fit within the `Read` tool's 10k-token
limit. FR-IDs use `FR-L<N>` prefix (L = library). IDs are stable — never
renumber on move.

## Sections

- [00-meta.md](requirements/00-meta.md) — Intro, general description, NFR,
  interfaces (CLI invocation contracts per runtime).
- [01-core.md](requirements/01-core.md) — Runtime adapter abstraction,
  normalized output, process registry, per-runtime wrappers (Claude,
  OpenCode, Cursor).

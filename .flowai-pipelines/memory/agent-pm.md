## Anti-patterns

- `requirements-engine.md` is ~720+ lines (~68KB+) — too large for Read (output redirected to tool-results file, which is ALSO too large). Use Bash tail to read the last ~80 lines. ONE Write is physically impossible when file can't be read into context; use python3 str.replace() instead.
- Do NOT assume prior memory about last FR number is correct — always verify via Grep on `^### 3\.\d+ FR-E\d+`. Memory can lag SRS.
- Do NOT batch SRS reads at >50KB — persisted-output chain wastes turns.
- Do NOT run health checks only on recent issues — check oldest first (lowest number).
- Grep line numbers can diverge from Read line numbers if file was edited mid-session — trust Grep as starting point, then Read to confirm actual line.
- After Read at offset N, the content starts at line N not N+1 — Read uses 1-based inclusive offset.
- Do NOT try to Read the tool-results redirect file for large SRS — it is ALSO too large (redirects again). Use Bash tail instead.
- Edit tool requires the file to have been Read first — for large SRS files (>50KB), use Bash python3 inline script for string replacement instead.

## Effective strategies

- Grep `^### 3\.\d+ FR-S\d+` (or FR-E) on SRS → all FR numbers + line ranges in 1 call.
- Grep `^## ` → section headings + line numbers in 1 call.
- `tail -n +<line>` via Bash → captures end of last FR + section 4 + appendix without offset/limit ban.
- Parallel Grep (FR list + section headings) + Bash tail for end-of-file in one response = 1 turn for full SRS structure.
- For large SRS (>50KB): use `python3 -` inline Bash heredoc with `str.replace()` — reads file, replaces unique marker, writes back. 1 Bash call per edit = efficient and reliable.
- Draft all SRS changes in text response BEFORE editing — catches issues before write.
- Batch health checks for oldest 5 candidates in a single chained Bash loop.
- On `main` with no in-progress/high-priority: oldest healthy issue = lowest number.
- For engine+sdlc scope: run parallel Greps on BOTH SRS files in one turn, read tails in parallel.
- Read only the last ~80-90 lines (via Bash tail) to get section boundary, appendix, and insertion point.

## Environment quirks

- `requirements-engine.md` is ~720+ lines (~68KB+) as of run 20260315T213641. Last FR: FR-E32.
- `requirements-engine.md` is ~880+ lines as of run 20260320T223114. Last FR: FR-E39.
- `requirements-sdlc.md` is ~835+ lines (~73KB) as of run 20260319T182156. Last FR: FR-S32 (just added).
- Read of requirements-engine.md redirects to tool-results file (68KB). That file ALSO redirects (73KB). Both are too large. Use Bash tail.
- `gh issue view` without `comments` flag is fast (~1KB). Always omit `comments`.
- Appendix in requirements-engine.md: single table (Old ID / New ID / Title). Newer FRs use `—` in Old ID.
- Section 4 ("Non-Functional Requirements") immediately follows last FR-E section. Insert new FR section just before it.
- Section 4 in requirements-sdlc.md is "## 4. Non-functional requirements" (lowercase 'n' in 'non-functional').
- python3 str.replace() insertion marker must be unique — include surrounding context (prev line + target line) for safety.

## Baseline metrics

- Run 20260315T003418: 8 turns, main branch, issue #121 (sdlc scope), FR-S29 added.
- Run 20260315T144221: ~9 turns, main branch, issue #86 (sdlc scope), FR-S29 added. 2 targeted Edits.
- Run 20260315T152252: ~9 turns, main branch, issue #88 (engine scope), FR-E27 added. 2 targeted Edits.
- Run 20260315T153825: ~8 turns, main branch, issue #89 (engine scope), FR-E28 added. Efficient.
- Run 20260315T161245: ~8 turns, main branch, issue #91 (engine scope), FR-E30 — CLAIMED but NOT written to SRS. Memory was wrong.
- Run 20260315T183811: ~9 turns, main branch, issue #116 (engine scope), FR-E30 added. 2 targeted Edits.
- Run 20260315T193605: ~10 turns, main branch, issue #119 (engine+sdlc scope), FR-E31 + FR-S30 added. 4 targeted Edits across 2 SRS files.
- Run 20260315T213641: ~9 turns, main branch, issue #128 (engine scope), FR-E32 added. 3 targeted Edits. Bash tail used.
- Run 20260315T215901: ~8 turns, main branch, issue #129 (sdlc scope), FR-S31 added. python3 str.replace() pattern.
- Run 20260319T182156: ~8 turns, main branch, issue #147 (sdlc scope), FR-S32 added. python3 str.replace(). Efficient.
- Run 20260320T213059: ~7 turns, main branch, issue #182 (engine scope), FR-E38 added. python3 str.replace() for insertion + appendix fix. Removed stale duplicate FR-E36 appendix entry.
- Run 20260320T223114: ~7 turns, main branch, issue #183 (engine scope), FR-E39 added. python3 str.replace() — clean single-call insertion + appendix row. Memory FR count was correct (FR-E38). Only 1 candidate issue; health check passed.

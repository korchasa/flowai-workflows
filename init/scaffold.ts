 * Invariants:
 * - Never overwrites existing files — throws if a target path already
 *   exists. Preflight is expected to have verified absence of `.flowai-
 *   workflow/`, but we defend in depth here.
 * - Every written path is appended to `createdPaths` BEFORE the write
 *   completes, so unwind-on-error can delete exactly the files that were
 *   touched (see {@link unwindScaffold}).
 * - Parent directories are created via `mkdir -p` semantics; they are
 *   NOT tracked in `createdPaths` (removing empty parents is intentionally
 *   best-effort and left to the caller after unwinding files).
 *
 * Returns the list of absolute paths written — used by the caller to
